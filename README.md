# Radiator temperature monitor

Note: this project has been superseeded by a new version that works via AWS. To view this, go to the repo https://github.com/EllisBarnwell/Rad_temperature_monitor_AWS.

This code can still be used to run the radiator monitoring system without using web services. To do so, follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/EllisBarnwell/Rad_temperature_monitor/blob/master/setupGuide.md).
